# verses_similarity
we have for each row two verses source and target with their revelance degree 2 if they're so close 1 if a bit close 0 if there's no relation between them we did the preprocessing from tokenization to removing stopwords to steeming then we use it three diffrent models from flair to extract the vectorial represantation of each verse then we're gonna compare each couple using cos similarity and finaly we're gonna use spearman or pearson between the list of cos_similarities and revelance_degrees the best model which is pool give us 0.55 which means there's a positive relationship in the dataset as a whole ( between -1 and 1 ) and the p-value is almost 0 which means we didn't get this by coincidence .
